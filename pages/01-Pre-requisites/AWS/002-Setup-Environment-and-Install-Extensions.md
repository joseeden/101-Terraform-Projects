# Setup your Environment and Install Extensions 

For this one, I'm using VS Code. We'll set it up with the following extensions:

- AWS Toolkit Extension
- Terraform Extension

## AWS Toolkit Extension

Click the View tab and then Extensions. In the search bar, type in the extension name.

Once installed, you should see the the AWS icon on the left panel and **Connect to AWS** in the Explorer tab. 

## Terraform Extension

In the Extensions panel of VSCode, search for the Terraform extension. There's an official extension from Hashicorp but it is still buggy during the creation of this notes thus I suggest to install the extension from Anton Kulikov.

Finally, create your working directory. For this lab, I called my working directory "lab01_build_dev_env".
